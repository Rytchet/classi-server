# Classic Car ( COMP 208 )
## Group 1 - Andrew, Richard, Perry, Tim, Oskar, Ben

### What is in this repo?

This repo contains all of the code for the website and the app, along with any relevant documentation we need throughout the project.

### Project Mission

With this project we aim to produce a website and iOS app for a classic car marketplace to compete with and hopefully replace the current, outdated best option. 

We aim to produce an attractive, easy to use website and app which allows users to view classic cars currently for sale around the UK and to list their own car for sale should they want to. The website needs to be easy to use to promote use by the older generation who are the primary purchasers of classic cars. We also want the website to be attractive to the younger generation which is why we are producing an iOS app to accompany the website.

### Project Tech Stack

Our Tech Stack consists of different aspects for Mobile and Web. Our one consistency throughout is our MongoDB cloud-database which makes use of JSON objects.

* MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) - Full JavaScript software stack.
* Swift + Objective-C - Cocoapods used also for dependencies

*subject to change throughout the project if needed*
